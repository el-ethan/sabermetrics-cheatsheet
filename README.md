# BABIP
_Batting average on balls In play_

## Formula
**BABIP = (H – HR)/(AB – K – HR + SF)**

Hits minus the number of home runs divided by at bats minus strikeouts and home runs with sacrifice flies added back in.

## Notes

* From FanGraphs:
  > BABIP allows us to see if a hitter seems to be getting a boost from poor defense or good luck or getting docked for facing good defenses and having bad luck.
  >...
  > pitchers with a high BABIP are most likely victims of poor defense or bad luck, and neither is the pitcher’s fault.

## Context:

* The average BABIP for _pitchers and hitters_ is also about .300
* The best hitters in the league are capable of BABIPs in the .350 range while the worst hitters might hang around .260
* You won’t see many pitchers outside of the .290 to .310 BABIP range.
